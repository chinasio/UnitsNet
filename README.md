### <a name="static-typing"></a>Static Typing

```C#
// Construct            
Length meter = Length.FromMeters(1);
Length twoMeters = new Length(2, LengthUnit.Meter);
          
// Convert
double cm = meter.Centimeters;         // 100
double yards = meter.Yards;            // 1.09361
double feet = meter.Feet;              // 3.28084
double inches = meter.Inches;          // 39.3701

// Pass quantity types instead of values to avoid conversion mistakes and communicate intent
string PrintPersonWeight(Mass weight)
{
    // No such thing! Weight in this context is Mass, not Force.
    double weightNewtons = weight.Newtons; 
    
    // Convert to the unit of choice - when you need it
    return $"You weigh {weight.Kilograms:F1} kg.";
}
```

### <a name="operator-overloads"></a>Operator Overloads

```C#
// Arithmetic
Length l1 = 2 * Length.FromMeters(1);
Length l2 = Length.FromMeters(1) / 2;
Length l3 = l1 + l2;

// Construct between units
Length distance = Speed.FromKilometersPerHour(80) * TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
Acceleration a1 = Speed.FromKilometersPerHour(80) / TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);
Acceleration a2 = Force.FromNewtons(100) / Mass.FromKilograms(20);
RotationalSpeed r = Angle.FromDegrees(90) / TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);
```

### <a name="culture"></a>Culture and Localization

The culture for abbreviations defaults to Thread.CurrentUICulture and falls back to US English if not defined. Thread.CurrentCulture affects number formatting unless a custom culture is specified. The relevant methods are:

* ToString()
* GetAbbreviation()
* Parse/TryParse()
* ParseUnit/TryParseUnit()
```C#
var usEnglish = new CultureInfo("en-US");
var russian = new CultureInfo("ru-RU");
var oneKg = Mass.FromKilograms(1);

// ToString() uses CurrentUICulture for abbreviation language and CurrentCulture for number formatting
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = russian;
string kgRu = oneKg.ToString(); // "1 кг"

// ToString() with specific culture and custom string format pattern
string mgUs = oneKg.ToUnit(MassUnit.Milligram).ToString(usEnglish, "unit: {1}, value: {0:F2}"); // "unit: mg, value: 1.00"
string mgRu = oneKg.ToUnit(MassUnit.Milligram).ToString(russian, "unit: {1}, value: {0:F2}"); // "unit: мг, value: 1,00"

// Parse measurement from string
Mass kg = Mass.Parse("1.0 kg", usEnglish);

// Parse unit from string, a unit can have multiple abbreviations
RotationalSpeedUnit rpm1 = RotationalSpeed.ParseUnit("rpm"); // RotationalSpeedUnit.RevolutionPerMinute
RotationalSpeedUnit rpm2 = RotationalSpeed.ParseUnit("r/min");  // RotationalSpeedUnit.RevolutionPerMinute

// Get default abbreviation for a unit, the first if more than one is defined in Length.json for Kilogram unit
string kgAbbreviation = Mass.GetAbbreviation(MassUnit.Kilogram); // "kg"
```

#### Gotcha: AmbiguousUnitParseException
Some units of a quantity have the same abbreviation, which means `.Parse()` is not able to know what unit you wanted.
Unfortunately there is no built-in way to avoid this, either you need to ensure you don't pass in input that cannot be parsed or you need to write your own parser that has more knowledge of preferred units or maybe only a subset of the units.

Example:
`Length.Parse("1 pt")` throws `AmbiguousUnitParseException` with message `Cannot parse "pt" since it could be either of these: DtpPoint, PrinterPoint`.

### Dynamically Parsing and Converting Quantities
Sometimes you need to work with quantities and units at runtime, such as parsing user input.
There are three classes to help with this:
- [UnitParser](UnitsNet/CustomCode/UnitParser.cs) for parsing unit abbreviation strings like `cm` to `LengthUnit.Centimeter`
- [UnitAbbreviationsCache](UnitsNet/CustomCode/UnitAbbreviationsCache.cs) for looking up unit abbreviations like `cm` given type `LengthUnit` and value `1` (`Centimeter`)
- [UnitConverter](UnitsNet/UnitConverter.cs) for converting values given a quantity name `Length`, a value `1` and from/to unit names `Centimeter` and `Meter`

```c#
// This type was perhaps selected by the user in GUI from a list of units
Type lengthUnitType = typeof(LengthUnit); // Selected by user in GUI from a list of units

// Parse units dynamically
UnitParser parser = UnitParser.Default;
int fromUnitValue = (int)parser.Parse("cm", lengthUnitType); // LengthUnit.Centimeter == 1

// Get unit abbreviations dynamically
var cache = UnitAbbreviationsCache.Default;
string fromUnitAbbreviation = cache.GetDefaultAbbreviation(lengthUnitType, 1); // "cm"

double centimeters = UnitConverter.ConvertByName(1, "Length", "Meter", "Centimeter"); // 100
```

For more examples on dynamic parsing and conversion, see the unit conversion applications below.

### <a name="example-app"></a>Example: Creating a dynamic unit converter app
[Source code](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/tree/master/Samples/UnitConverter.Wpf) for `Samples/UnitConverter.Wpf`<br/>
[Download](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/releases/tag/UnitConverterWpf%2F2018-11-09) (release 2018-11-09 for Windows)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/787816/34920961-9b697004-f97b-11e7-9e9a-51ff7142969b.png)


This example shows how you can create a dynamic unit converter, where the user selects the quantity to convert, such as `Temperature`, then selects to convert from `DegreeCelsius` to `DegreeFahrenheit` and types in a numeric value for how many degrees Celsius to convert.

Pseudo-code for converter app:
```c#
// Populate quantity selector ("Length", "Mass", "Force" etc)
string[] quantityNames = UnitsHelper.QuantityNames;

string selectedQuantityName = "Temperature"; // Selected by user
QuantityType selectedQuantity = Enum.Parse<QuantityType>(selectedQuantityName); // QuantityType.Temperature

// Populate from/to unit selectors when quantity selection changes
string[] unitNames = UnitsHelper.GetUnitNamesForQuantity(selectedQuantity).ToArray();
myGui.UpdateFromToListsOfUnits(unitNames);

// Assign these from GUI selection
double fromValue = 25;
string fromUnitName = "DegreeCelsius";
string toUnitName = "DegreeFahrenheit";

// Convert using from value and selected quantity/unit names
double convertedValue = UnitConverter.ConvertByName(fromValue, selectedQuantityName, fromUnitName, toUnitName);
```

NOTE: There are still some limitations in the library that requires reflection to enumerate units for quantity and getting the abbreviation for a unit, when we want to dynamically enumerate and convert between units.

### <a name="example-app-hardcoded"></a>Example: Creating a unit converter app with hard coded quantities

If you can live with hard coding what quantities to convert between, then the following code snippet shows you one way to go about it:

```C#
// Get quantities for populating quantity UI selector
QuantityType[] quantityTypes = Enum.GetValues(typeof(QuantityType)).Cast<QuantityType>().ToArray();

// If Length is selected, get length units for populating from/to UI selectors
LengthUnit[] lengthUnits = Length.Units;

// Perform conversion using input value and selected from/to units
double inputValue; // Obtain from textbox
LengthUnit fromUnit, toUnit; // Obtain from ListBox selections
double resultValue = Length.From(inputValue, fromUnit).As(toUnit);
```

### Example: WPF app using IValueConverter to parse quantities from input

Src: [Samples/WpfMVVMSample](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/tree/master/Samples/WpfMVVMSample)

![wpfmvvmsample_219w](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/787816/34913417-094332e2-f8fd-11e7-9d8a-92db105fbbc9.png)


The purpose of this app is to show how to create an `IValueConverter` in order to bind XAML to quantities.

NOTE: A lot of reflection and complexity were introduced due to not having a base type. See #371 for discussion on adding base types.

### <a name="precision"></a>Precision and Accuracy

A base unit is chosen for each unit class, represented by a double value (64-bit), and all conversions go via this unit. This means that there will always be a small error in both representing other units than the base unit as well as converting between units.

Units.NET was intended for convenience and ease of use, not highly accurate conversions, but I am open to suggestions for improvements.

The tests accept an error up to 1E-5 for most units added so far. Exceptions include units like Teaspoon, where the base unit cubic meter is a lot bigger. In many usecases this is sufficient, but for others this may be a showstopper and something you need to be aware of.

For more details, see [Precision](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/wiki/Precision).


### <a name="serialization"></a>Serialization

* `UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet` ([nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet), [src](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/tree/master/UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet), [tests](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/tree/master/UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests)) for JSON.NET

**Important!** 
We cannot guarantee backwards compatibility, although we will strive to do that on a "best effort" basis and bumping the major nuget version when a change is necessary.

The base unit of any unit should be treated as volatile as we have changed this several times in the history of this library already. Either to reduce precision errors of common units or to simplify code generation. An example is Mass, where the base unit was first Kilogram as this is the SI unit of mass, but in order to use powershell scripts to generate milligrams, nanograms etc. it was easier to choose Gram as the base unit of Mass.


### <a name="contribute"></a>Want To Contribute?

This project is still early and many units and conversions are not yet covered. If you are missing something, please help by contributing or [ask for it](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/issues) by creating an issue.

Please read the wiki on [Adding a New Unit](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/wiki/Adding-a-New-Unit).

Generally adding a unit involves adding or modifying `UnitsNet\UnitDefinitions\*.json` files and running `generate-code.bat` to regenerate the source code and test code stubs, then manually implementing the new unit conversion constants in the test code.
